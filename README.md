# CSC494_holoprojector

This CSC494 project is inspired by the paper ["holocurtain"](https://imaging.cs.cmu.edu/holocurtains/). Its core mechanism is to construct a highly-programmable and light-efficient structured light solution with high frame rate, which is called "binary holography". By combining binary holography with rolling-shutter camera, the programmable light curtain, holocuratin, is constructed.

This semester, mentored by Esther Lin, I aim at using similar set of laser source and digital micromirror device (DMD) to replicate binary holography.

This repository records all notes, codes, and resources I've worked on.
